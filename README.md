# First_AI-ML-DS_Project
This is my first project in the field of AI and machine learning. I explored fundamental data cleaning and visualization techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project focuses on preparing and understanding data‚Äîan essential step in any ML workflow.

## üß† What I Learned

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating informative plots to explore and understand data distributions, relationships, and trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and cleaning
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For basic plotting and charting
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For advanced and attractive statistical visualizations
